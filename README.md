# DiabeticRetinopathy

Developed an AI model using Convolutional Neural Networks to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in fundus images. 
• Achieved 73% accuracy in identifying the severity of DR using a dataset of 35,000+ images classified into five categories: no DR, mild,                himoderate, severe, and proliferate DR. 
• Created a front-end using React where users can upload a picture and access the model on the Flask server in the backend to determine    sathe stage of DR.
